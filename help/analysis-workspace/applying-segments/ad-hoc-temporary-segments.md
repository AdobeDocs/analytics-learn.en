# Ad Hoc (Temporary) Segments in Analysis Workspace {#ad-hoc-temporary-segments-in-analysis-workspace}

Have you ever wanted to quickly create a simple segment to answer a specific question, then discard the segment so it doesn't fill up your list of saved segments? Now you can!

Ad hoc segments work within the project where they are created, but they don't get saved permanently unless you choose to save them.
