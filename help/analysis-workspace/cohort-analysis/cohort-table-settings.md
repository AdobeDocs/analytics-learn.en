# Cohort Table Settings

There are several Cohort table settings that allow you to customize your view of retention or churn. See them highlighted in this video.

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/29433/?quality=12)

Customizations for the Cohort Table include the ability to

1. Display percentages only
1. Round percentages to the nearest whole number
1. Show/hide an average percent row at the top of the table.

The average row is especially helpful in viewing retention or churn overall, rather than by individual cohort rows.
