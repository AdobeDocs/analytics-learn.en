# [!UICONTROL Cohort Table] Settings

There are several Â¨ settings that allow you to customize your view of [!UICONTROL retention] or [!UICONTROL churn]. See them highlighted in this video.

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/29433/?quality=12&learn=on)

Customizations for the [!UICONTROL Cohort Table] include the ability to

1. Display percentages only
1. Round percentages to the nearest whole number
1. Show/hide an average percent row at the top of the table.

The average row is especially helpful in viewing [!UICONTROL retention] or [!UICONTROL churn] overall, rather than by individual [!UICONTROL cohort] rows.
