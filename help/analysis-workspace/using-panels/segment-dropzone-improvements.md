# Segment Drop Zone Improvements in Analysis Workspace {#segment-drop-zone-improvements-in-analysis-workspace}

Segment drop zones have been improved so you can truly drop anything anywhere in a project.

You can now drop full dimensions and events, in addition to the existing support for dimension items, date ranges and segments. Additionally, we've improved how dimension items of "unspecified" and "none" are handled when dropped in the segment drop zone.
