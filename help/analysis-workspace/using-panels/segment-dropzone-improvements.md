# [!UICONTROL Segment] Drop Zone Improvements in Analysis Workspace {#segment-drop-zone-improvements-in-analysis-workspace}

[!UICONTROL Segment] drop zones have been improved so you can truly drop anything anywhere in a project.

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/24036/?quality=12)

You can now drop full [!UICONTROL dimensions] and [!UICONTROL metrics], in addition to the existing support for [!UICONTROL dimension] items, [!UICONTROL date ranges] and [!UICONTROL segments]. Additionally, we've improved how [!UICONTROL dimension] items of "unspecified" and "none" are handled when dropped in the [!UICONTROL segment] drop zone.
