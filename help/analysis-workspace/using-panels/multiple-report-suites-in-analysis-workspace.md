# Multiple [!UICONTROL Report Suites] in Analysis Workspace

Multiple [!UICONTROL report suites] can be analyzed in a single [!DNL Workspace] project by selecting [!UICONTROL report suites] at the panel level. This allows you to conduct side-by-side panel analysis across different sets of data.

>[!TIP]
>
> To apply a [!UICONTROL report suite] to all panels at once, right-click on any panel and select “[!UICONTROL Apply report suite to all panels]”.  

Data from multiple [!UICONTROL report suites] cannot be combined in tables, [!UICONTROL segments] or [!UICONTROL calculated metrics] (summed, divided, etc). The best practice for a holistic data approach continues to be sending all hits to a 'global suite'.
