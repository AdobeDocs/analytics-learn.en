While it is great to have Adobe Standard Templates, sometimes you just want your own template. Now you can create any project into your own custom template. Itâ€™s even easier to help new users get up to speed, find your favorite dashboards / projects, or share your dashboard across teams.

For more information on standard + custom templates, visit the [documentation](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/analysis-workspace/starter_projects.html).
