While it is great to have [!UICONTROL Adobe Standard Templates], sometimes you just want your own template. Now you can create any project into your own custom template. Itâ€™s even easier to help new users get up to speed, find your favorite dashboards / projects, or share your dashboard across teams.

For more information on standard + custom templates, visit the [documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/starter-projects.html?lang=en).
