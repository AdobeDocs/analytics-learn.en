**UPDATE**: There have been several improvements made to [!DNL Workspace] since this video was published. We are leaving the video live because it has some great tips that you should know anyway.

**First**, be sure to check out the [!UICONTROL Attribution IQ] features that will help take your marketing attribution analysis even further. This includes the following videos and the videos around them:

* [Using the Attribution IQ Panel](using-the-attribution-iq-panel.md)
* [Adding side-by-side comparisons of Attribution IQ Models](adding-side-by-side-comparisons-of-attribution-iq-models.md)
* [Algorithmic Model in Attribution IQ](algorithmic-model-in-attribution-iq.md)
* [Custom Look-back Windows in Attribution IQ](custom-lookback-windows-in-attribution-iq.md)

**Second**, if you are following the steps in this video, be aware that you can [use the Freeform Table Builder](../building-freeform-tables/using-the-freeform-table-builder-in-analysis-workspace.md) to setup your table.

* 3:20 - Cross-tab dimensions are automatically dynamic when dropped, meaning their values can change over time. For this analysis, it's best to bring over static columns instead. Learn more about Dynamic Columns at 6:33 of the video: [Row and Column Settings in Freeform Tables](../building-freeform-tables/row-and-column-settings-in-freeform-tables.md)
* 4:30 - Column settings can be updated in bulk now, instead of 1-by-1. Learn more at 8:45 of the video: [Row and Column Settings in Freeform Tables](../building-freeform-tables/row-and-column-settings-in-freeform-tables.md)
