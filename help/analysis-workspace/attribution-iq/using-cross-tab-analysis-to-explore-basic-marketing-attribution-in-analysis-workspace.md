**UPDATE**: There have been several improvements made to [!DNL Workspace] since this video was published. We are leaving the video live because it has some great tips that you should know anyway.

**First**, be sure to check out the [!UICONTROL Attribution IQ] features that will help take your marketing attribution analysis even further. This includes the following videos and the videos around them:

* [Using the Attribution IQ Panel](using-the-attribution-iq-panel.md)
* [Adding side-by-side comparisons of Attribution IQ Models](adding-side-by-side-comparisons-of-attribution-iq-models.md)
* [Algorithmic Model in Attribution IQ](algorithmic-model-in-attribution-iq.md)
* [Custom Look-back Windows in Attribution IQ](custom-lookback-windows-in-attribution-iq.md)

**Second**, if you are following the steps in this video, be aware that you can [use the Freeform Table Builder](../building-freeform-tables/using-the-freeform-table-builder-in-analysis-workspace.md) to setup your table.

* 3:20 - Cross-tab dimensions are now dynamic when dropped, meaning their values can change over time. For this analysis, it's best to bring over static columns instead. Learn more: [Dynamic Columns](../building-freeform-tables/dynamic-columns.md)
* 4:30 - Column settings can be updated in bulk now, instead of 1-by-1. Learn more: [Column Settings](../building-freeform-tables/column-settings-updates-in-analysis-workspace-text-wrapping.md)
