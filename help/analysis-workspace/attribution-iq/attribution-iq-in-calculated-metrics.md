# [!DNL Attribution IQ] in [!DNL Calculated Metrics] {#attribution-iq-in-calculated-metrics}

This video demonstrates how to use [!DNL Attribution IQ] in [!DNL Calculated Metrics].

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/23140/?quality=12)

[!DNL Calculated Metrics] now support any of ten rules-based [!DNL attribution models]. [!DNL Calculated metrics] allow you to compare [!DNL attribution models] (for example, subtracting [!UICONTROL First Touch] from [!UICONTROL Last Touch]) to see the difference. You can also create hybrid models (for example, 50% [!UICONTROL Time Decay] plus 50% [!UICONTROL First Touch]), or apply attribution to your important conversion metrics such as revenue per orders, or orders per visit.
