Calculated Metrics now support any of ten rules-based attribution models. Calculated metrics allow you to compare attribution models (for example, subtracting First Touch from Last Touch) to see the difference. You can also create hybrid models (for example, 50% Time Decay plus 50% First Touch), or apply attribution to your important conversion metrics such as revenue per orders, or orders per visit.
