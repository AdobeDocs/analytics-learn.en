The [!DNL Attribution IQ] [!UICONTROL Panel] in Analysis Workspace is a way to quickly compare any of ten rules-based [!DNL attribution models] in a visual way. See how each model is impacting any dimension using [!DNL Bar Charts], [!DNL Venn diagrams], [!DNL Histograms], [!DNL Scatter Plots], and even a [!DNL Flow Diagram]. The [!DNL Attribution] [!UICONTROL Panel] is a great starting point for more sophisticated attribution analysis.
