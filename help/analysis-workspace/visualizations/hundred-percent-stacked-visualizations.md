Stacked graphs are helpful for representing parts of a whole in a trend. The 100% stacked visualization setting further helps to quickly see how each part contributes to the whole, in terms of a % value instead of a raw value. This setting is available from the visualization settings gear in the top right of area stacked, bar stacked, and horizontal bar stacked visualizations.
