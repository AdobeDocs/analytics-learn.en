# 100% Stacked [!UICONTROL Visualizations] In Analysis Workspace {#stacked-visualizations-in-analysis-workspace}

In this video, you will learn how to set your stacked visualizations as percentages instead of only raw values.

Stacked graphs are helpful for representing parts of a whole in a trend. The new 100% stacked viz setting further helps to quickly see how each part contributes to the whole, in terms of a % value instead of a raw value. This new setting is available from the [!UICONTROL Visualization] Settings gear in the top right of [!UICONTROL Area Stacked], [!UICONTROL Bar Stacked] and [!UICONTROL Horizontal Bar Stacked] vizs.
