In Analysis Workspace, we now offer more filtering control, with 11 filter criteria & AND/OR operators.

For more information on the filters available, visit the [documentation](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/analysis-workspace/pagination_filtering_sorting.html).

**Note:** Advanced special characters are not available in Analysis Workspace.
