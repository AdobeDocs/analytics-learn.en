# Freeform table filters in Analysis Workspace

Filters provide more control over what rows of data are shared in a [!DNL freeform table].

In Analysis Workspace, we now offer more filtering control, with 11 filter criteria & AND/OR operators.

For more information on the filters available, visit the [documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/pagination-filtering-sorting.html#cja-workspace?lang=en).

**Note:** Advanced special characters are not available in Analysis Workspace.
