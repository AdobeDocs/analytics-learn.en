# Introduction to the [!DNL Analytics for Advertising Cloud] DSP Integration {#introduction-to-the-analytics-for-advertising-cloud-dsp-integration}

The [!DNL Analytics for Advertising Cloud] DSP integration is a native bi-directional integration between Adobe Analytics and Adobe Advertising Cloud. With this integration, capture `Viewthroughs` from Advertising Cloud ad impressions into [!DNL Analytics]. [!DNL Analytics] connects `Viewthroughs` to all downstream site activity, like a `Clickthrough`. [!DNL Analytics] passes [!DNL metrics] back to the [!DNL Advertising Cloud] and is used in advanced algorithmic bidding models. This video covers what a `Viewthrough` is, the benefits of the integration, and a few basic examples of using the new [!UICONTROL dimensions] and [!UICONTROL metrics] in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace].
