# Introduction to the Analytics for Adobe Advertising DSP Integration

The [!DNL Adobe Advertising] DSP integration is a native bi-directional integration between Adobe Analytics and Adobe Advertising DSP. This integration captures `Viewthroughs` from Advertising ad impressions into [!DNL Analytics]. [!DNL Analytics] connects `Viewthroughs` to all downstream site activity, such as `Clickthroughs`. [!DNL Analytics] passes [!DNL metrics] back to the [!DNL Advertising DSP] to feed advanced algorithmic bidding models. This video covers the `Viewthrough` metric, the benefits of the integration, and provides basic examples of using the [!UICONTROL dimensions] and [!UICONTROL metrics] in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace].
