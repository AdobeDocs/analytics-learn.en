title: Introduction to the Analytics for Advertising Cloud DSP Integration
description: The Analytics for Advertising Cloud DSP integration is a native bi-directional integration between Adobe Analytics and Adobe Advertising Cloud. With this integration, customers can capture Viewthroughs from Advertising Cloud ad impressions into Analytics. Analytics can then connect the Viewthroughs to all downstream site activity (just like a Clickthrough). Analytics can then pass metrics back to Advertising Cloud to be used in advanced algorithmic bidding models. This video covers what a Viewthrough is, the benefits of the integration, and a few basic examples of using the new Dimensions/Metrics in Analysis Workspace.
