# Map Web SDK variables into Adobe Analytics

Learn how to map analytics variables from the Web SDK through to Adobe Analytics using Processing Rules.

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/333606/?quality=12&learn=on)

## Additional Information

For a list of the automatically mapped variables from the Web SDK to Adobe Analytics, please see this [documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/data-collection/adobe-analytics/automatically-mapped-vars.html)

**NOTE:** When setting up Processing Rules, you may find that the "a.x.[your schema]" variable is not automatically in the drop-down window. If it is not there, don't panic. Just type it in according to the format, and add it as a contextData variable. After adding one or two, you may find that others are lazy-loaded.
