You can start tracking download links on your site (links that download non-browser files to your machine) in just a few clicks in the Adobe Analytics extension in Experience Platform [!DNL tags].

Whether it's whitepapers, manuals, audio or video files, or a host of other possibilities, you may have links on your site to download files that don't open in a browser. On these files, you cannot have [!DNL Analytics] code on the page for tracking. The configuration explained in the video allows you to track the link to the download file.
