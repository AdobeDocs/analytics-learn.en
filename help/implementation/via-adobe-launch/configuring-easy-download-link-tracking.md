# Configuring Easy Download [!UICONTROL Link Tracking] in [!DNL Experience Platform Launch] {#configuring-easy-download-link-tracking-in-adobe-launch}

In just a few clicks in the Adobe Analytics [!UICONTROL Extension] in Adobe [!DNL Experience Platform Launch], you can start tracking download links on your site (links that download non-browser files on your machine). This video shows you how to set it up.

Whether it be whitepapers, manuals, audio or video files, or a host of other possibilities, you may have links on your site to download files that don't open in a browser. At the very least, even if they do open in a browser (like a text file), you cannot have [!DNL Analytics] code on the page for tracking. Therefore, you need to track the link TO the download file.

This is very quick and easy in [!DNL Experience Platform Launch], using the configuration of the [!DNL Analytics] extension.
