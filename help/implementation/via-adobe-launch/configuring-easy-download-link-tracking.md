Whether it be whitepapers, manuals, audio or video files, or a host of other possibilities, you may have links on your site to download files that don't open in a browser. At the very least, even if they do open in a browser (like a text file), you cannot have [!DNL Analytics] code on the page for tracking. Therefore, you need to track the link TO the download file.

This is very quick and easy in [!DNL Launch], using the configuration of the [!DNL Analytics] [!UICONTROL extension].
