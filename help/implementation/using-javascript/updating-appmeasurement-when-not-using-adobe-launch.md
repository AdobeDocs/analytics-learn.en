# Updating AppMeasurement When Not Using [!DNL Experience Platform Launch] {#updating-appmeasurement-when-not-using-adobe-launch}

This video shows you how to update your appMeasurement code when you are not using Adobe [!DNL Experience Platform Launch]. This includes where to get the code and where to update it.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you use a non-Adobe tag management solution, you must treat [!DNL AppMeasurement] updates as if you were using no tag management solution. Meaning, wherever you have your AppMeasurement code, that's where you perform the update (retrieve the new code and replace the old code in the file or in the TMS). If you use [!DNL Experience Platform Launch], updates are quick and easy and no code needs to be copied or pasted.
