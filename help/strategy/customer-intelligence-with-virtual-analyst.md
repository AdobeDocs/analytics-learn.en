# Mastering customer intelligence with Virtual Analyst and Segment IQ in Adobe Analytics

In this article, you learn the importance of leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML). Next, review the benefits and real-world success stories from global customers using Virtual Analyst and Segment IQ to detect anomalies, avoid outliers, and maximize ROI.

## The value of artificial intelligence

Perhaps you recall the time chess champion Garry Kasparov was defeated by IBM's Deep Blue. Experts were convinced a machine could not possibly beat human decision making and judgment in a game as complex as chess. Yet, it was done and this was key to a fundamental shift in business strategy and technological innovation as the power of artificial intelligence was unearthed.

Adobe Analytics is the core system of intelligence for the experience business, enabling anyone in the enterprise to understand and optimize customer interactions with their brand across all touch-points in real-time and at massive scale.

Adobe's AI tools are not here to replace you, but rather to enable you to achieve maximum ROI on your efforts.

## Transform your analytics

To evolve your analytics, we need to focus on three key considerations:

1. Organization - How to create holistic views of customers, prioritize insight-driven decisions and democratize data.

1. Technology - How to make sure data and technology deliver personalization at scale.

1. Customer - How to build trust and adapt to change.

Analytics is challenging and time-consuming, yet there is a constant need to accelerate time-to-insight. Key issues organizations face include:

* Limited organizational resources - various business goals can limit resource availability
* Limited technical expertise - can knowledge be shared and data democratized
* Customer expectations - can your team react dynamically to customer behaviors changes

### 3 Levels of customer intelligence

When it comes to a successful customer intelligence strategy, we need to move through three levels (see Figure 1 above) from: (a) data collection, to (b) data processing, to (c) analytics and machine learning, before we can finally take action and optimize our content and ads.

1. Data collection depends on your organization and may include a variety of channels and mediums, such as OTT devices, video, enterprise, call centers, in-store, social email, web, ads, mobile apps, wearables, IoT, voice assistants, connected cards, and geo / spatial.

1. Data processing includes real-time data collection, processing rules, audience syndication, context-aware sessionization, real-time triggers and views, and platform.

1. Analytics and machine learning includes Segment IQ, Virtual Analyst, Segmentation, Analysis Workspace
