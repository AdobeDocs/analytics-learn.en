# Analytics Fundamentals for Business Users has been retired 

We have retired this course for several reasons, including:

* Out-dated and inaccurate content
* Lack of overall organization
* Original course was too broad

For these reasons all together, we decided it would serve you, our wonderful customers, better if we reorganized, re-recorded, and re-released courses that are more specifically titled, so that you can know exactly what you are getting as you go through the courses.

If you are in a Business User, Business Practioner, or other similar role, we recommend that you take the following courses to get the fundamentals that will help you excel in using Analysis Workspace:

1. [Getting Started with Analysis Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/?recommended=Analytics-U-1-2020.1.workspace)
1. [Freeform Tables, the Foundation of Analysis](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/?recommended=Analytics-U-1-2020.3)
1. [Using Visualizations to Tell your Data Stories](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/?recommended=Analytics-U-1-2021.1.visualizations)
1. [Attributing Value to Digital Touch-points in the Customer Journey](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/?recommended=Analytics-U-1-2020.2)

There are additional courses related to [Adobe Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/?recommended=Analytics-U-1-2020.1.workspace) available to you on Experience League.

Thanks!
