# Using Drop-Down Filters in Analysis Workspace{#using-drop-down-filters-in-analysis-workspace}

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/23877/?quality=12)

The panel drop zone now has drop-down filtering capabilities. Drop-down filters enable analysts & end users to interact with the data through controlled filters. You can create a drop-down filter from any component type, and then switch between items in the drop-down to filter the panel contents. You can also add multiple drop-downs to a single panel for added control.

Drop-downs are a helpful way for consolidating projects & panels as well. For example, if you have several versions of a project that provides country-specific reporting, you can now collapse those projects into a single project, and add in a country drop-down that users can toggle between.
