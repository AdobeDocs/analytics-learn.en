>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/23139/?quality=12)

The Attribution IQ Panel in Analysis Workspace is a way to quickly compare any of ten rules-based attribution models in a visual way. See how each model is impacting any dimension using Bar Charts, Venn diagrams, Histograms, Scatter Plots, and even a Flow Diagram. The Attribution Panel is a great starting point for more sophisticated attribution analysis.
