# Using the Usage Log Tracking for Analysis Workspace{#using-the-usage-log-tracking-for-analysis-workspace}

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/22922/?quality=12)

Workspace tracking options include:

* Project creation (saving a new project)
* Project updates (saving edits to a project)
* Project shares
* Project unshares
* Project deletions
* Project views

Project views will be the best indication of whether or not your users are using Workspace or even opening projects shared with them.
