# Configuring Easy Download Link Tracking in Adobe Launch{#configuring-easy-download-link-tracking-in-adobe-launch}

Whether it be whitepapers, manuals, audio or video files, or a host of other possibilities, you may have links on your site to download files that don't open in a browser. At the very least, even if they do open in a browser (like a text file), you cannot have Analytics code on the page for tracking. Therefore, you need to track the link to the download file.

This is very quick and easy in Launch, using the configuration of the Analytics extension.
