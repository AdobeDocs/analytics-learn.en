It can be difficult to stay on top of your organization’s server call consumption, leading to frustration around overages. With Server Call usage reporting, you can track exactly how much of your server call commitment you’ve used at any point in time, and will also proactively alert you when you are approaching your total commitment. The accompanying dashboard allows you to analyze where your server calls are being used, so you can fix runaway implementations or work with colleagues to scale back in places where large volumes of less-valuable data might be getting collected.

Please note: Alert capabilities will be released on August 9, 2018.
