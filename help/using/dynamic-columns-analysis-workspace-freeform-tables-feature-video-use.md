In Analysis Workspace Freeform Tables, you've long been able to bring in a dimension as a column of a report to create a cross-tab analysis. We would render the top 5 (or 15 items for time dimensions) and retain those items as static items, meaning they would not change with time. We are changing this default behavior to treat those items as dynamic, while still giving you the option to make those items static if needed.
