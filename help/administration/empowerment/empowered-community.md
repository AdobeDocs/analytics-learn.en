# Creating an empowered community

An empowered community is defined as being supported by its Adobe Analytics administrators. It is knowledgeable on how business requirements are represented within their implementation, and it has the means to confidently use analysis for data-driven decision making. Many businesses benefit from the structure that an internal Adobe Analytics user group or a more formal community provides.

Here are the steps to create an empowered community within your organization.

**1. Build a solid infrastructure, the foundation for your empowered community**

* Create a new user onboarding process - What are the requirements and/or processes associated with Adobe Analytics access for your business? If you don't yet have requirements and a process in place for new user onboarding, creating that infrastructure will support scalability. 

* Implement proper user management and access - User access to report suites, metrics, dimensions, tools, reports, and components are foundational to Adobe Analytics, and a key part of the [user group management process](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-console/home.html?lang=en). Proper tool access allows for users to become empowered for self-service within Analysis Workspace and/or Reports and Analytics.

* Understanding the Implementation - As a best practice, end users must have a baseline knowledge of the business requirements supported by their implementation, which are typically captured via a business requirements document (BRD) and solution design reference (SDR) document. This should be inclusive of what has been implemented and why/what are the business requirements, reports, eVar(s), event(s), etc. by category. 

* Use report templates - Adobe Analytics Report Templates and/or Projects are key resources for enabling tool users on your business' implementation, reporting use cases, and best practices. These resources should address common business questions, and how they can be best answered within the tool? 

**2. Create a plan for who will run it, and who should be involved**

* Decide who will run the community - An empowered community starts with an infrastructure based around the administration and implementation of business requirements. Thus, the team(s) managing a business' Adobe Analytics administration and enablement are typically key to the management of a user group or internal community.

* Define who will be involved, roles and responsibilities:

  * Administration project team: The team managing the business' user group or community is typically responsible for defining the opportunity (e.g., via a project charter), creating the content plan (at least initially), and determining communication vehicles (e.g., Microsoft team, email distribution, quarterly call, etc.).
  * Executive sponsor: It will be key to have an executive sponsor to support the success of your business's internal user group or community. This role will be key for supporting milestones, communication, ensuring prioritization across the broader team, and change management.
  * Supporting functions responsibilities: Depending upon the size and structure of your organization, it may be beneficial to engage teams such as Web Development, Personalization, Testing, etc.
  * Tool users: There is an opportunity for anyone that has the potential to impact data aligned to your business' Adobe Analytics implementation to get involved-regardless of title or role! 

* Remember – “What’s in it for them?” Keeping your community focused on business use cases + priorities will help ensure engagement & success! 

**3. Leverage tools to start building your community**

* Create a project charter - A project charter is often a great way to align your business around the opportunity for an internal, empowered community. By answering the following questions, you will have what you need to draft your charter:

  * What is the problem statement that you are trying to solve, what is your community goal, and what do you foresee as in scope or out of scope?
  * “What’s in it for me” - What are the potential benefits or costs, how will you measure success, and what are the risks?
  * What is the timeline for getting a community live? What setup work is needed from an enablement, tool, admin user groups, etc. perspective? It is typically best to have baseline enablement resources developed before launching a larger initiative. 
  * How will core team members be to the community's success, and who will be supported within the initiative?
  * Lastly, who is your executive sponsor? We cannot emphasize enough the value of a strong executive sponsor, someone to sign-off on supporting the work and its value.

* Build a content plan - While your community will have content ideas for you as well, you should have ideas to kickstart engagement as well. A good rule of thumb is to have at least 6-12 months of content ideated at any given point in time.

  * Are there topics that might align to larger business initiatives, such as key events, larger programs, planning periods, etc.?
  * Who might be best to speak on such topics? How could they benefit from community engagement?
  * What content would the presentation ideally include, and what questions might it answer?

* Create a communication plan - A solid communication plan will be key to your community's engagement and overall success. Some questions to consider when creating your plan are:
  
  * What teams will be impacted by your community, who is your target audience (e.g., executives, managers, frontline analysts)? 
  * What are your key message focuses, what messages are needed, what's in it for your target audience (WIIFM), and what asks do you have?
  * What communication vehicles should be used (e.g. email, Slack, video, meetings, etc.) before or after the community launch? For example, will you be sending emails through the Adobe Analytics admin tool, or should your new user onboarding process now include maintenance of an internal email distribution list that can be utilized for newsletters, etc.? 
  * Who will be sending communication?
  * When? Key to consider both communications before the community launch, as well as that which will need to be provided on an ongoing basis following the launch. 

* Use your community vehicle to go live! Depending upon your business' tech stack, you will also want to choose a tool or vehicle for your community. This will be custom to your organization, but many often find Microsoft Teams to work well.

**4. Maintain your community, ensuring its sustained success**

•	Reserve time – Add Community meetings to calendars to block time in advance, recurring meetings are a great idea where possible, and will help bring your content plan to life. Here are some agenda ideas to help get you started:
o	o   If your business is hosting virtual events, what digital learnings and insights can be shared more broadly?
o	o   If your website utilizes interactive tools (e.g. chatbots, savings calculators, demos, etc.), how is performance data being leveraged? What insights can be gained to better support customers and the customer journey?
o	o   How is your business leveraging existing capabilities to enhance and leverage audience insights? For example, is your business using the new Adobe Analytics and Marketo integration? What learnings/insights can be shared more broadly?
•	Set expectations – Continue to leverage your project charter and communication plan to set expectations around what your community is, and what it isn’t. Consistency is key!  
•	Plan for engagement – While your Community is getting started, it may be beneficial to designate someone to monitor/engage teams via the chat during meetings and via your Community vehicle(s).
•	Gather feedback – To continue to ensure that meetings, speakers, content, etc. are relevant, take the time to plan out bi-annual surveys and offer opportunities for feedback. Many find it helpful to debrief with Community project teams following meetings and key milestones.
